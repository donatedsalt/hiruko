# TODOs

list of todos

## Todo

- [ ] fix invalid date error
- [ ] give the AI access to user data (e.g., income, expenses, balance) after asking permission to improve AI response
- [ ] market tracking (e.g., crypto, stocks, gold, currencies)
- [ ] settings page
- [ ] checkbox to disable or enable deletion conformation in settings
- [ ] premium features like family budgets and goals tracking
- [ ] take image of receipts to automatically add transactions

## Bugs

- [ ] edit form drops `goalId` (never read from FormData) and type-flip income↔expense can double-count budget — `convex/transactions/mutations.ts`, `src/app/(dashboard)/transactions/[id]/page.tsx`
- [ ] budget/goal `transactionCount` not adjusted on transaction `update`; budget/goal `remove` doesn't reverse counters — `convex/{transactions,budgets,goals}/mutations.ts`
- [ ] `accounts.remove` and `categories.remove` cascade-delete transactions without reversing budget/goal/category counters — `convex/{accounts,categories}/mutations.ts`
- [ ] `accounts.update` balance-correction bypasses `adjustAccount` and overwrites balance non-atomically — `convex/accounts/mutations.ts:107-160`
- [ ] typo: `goalLoading = budgets === undefined` (and `budLoading` swap) — `src/app/(dashboard)/transactions/[id]/page.tsx:69,376`
- [ ] `groupByDate` keys by UTC day → non-UTC users see transactions in wrong bucket — `convex/transactions/queries.ts:106`
- [ ] `validation/budget.ts` uses `.positive()` on `spent` — rejects legal value `0`
- [ ] `useSmartRouter` returns unbound `router.back/forward` — can throw — `src/hooks/use-smart-router.ts:23-31`

## Security

- [ ] `/api/chat` has no auth, rate limit, or input validation — anyone can drain Gemini key — `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`
- [ ] `next.config.ts` is empty — add CSP / security headers, `poweredByHeader: false`
- [ ] `HistoryTracker` localStorage key not namespaced per user — paths leak between accounts after sign-out — `src/components/history-tracker.tsx`

- [x] clamp budget/goal Progress with `Math.min(100, ...)`
- [x] fix `AddGoalCard` payload using wrong field (`balance` → `amount`)
- [x] sidebar active-route highlighting + nav-main `asChild` link wiring
- [x] add `aria-label` to icon-only floating add button and theme toggle
- [x] rename `CateogryList` → `CategoryList`
- [x] drop hex fallbacks on chart CSS vars
- [x] `ErrorMessage` shows the actual error message as the heading
- [x] extract shared `EmptyState`; rename duplicate `DataListSkeleton` → `TransactionListSkeleton`/`CategoryListSkeleton`
- [x] consolidate page padding to `p-4 md:p-6`; remove `px-4 lg:px-6` from list internals
- [x] always render Add card as last grid child (drop parity hack)
- [x] add `--success` token; replace raw `text-emerald-500`/`bg-emerald-500` with `text-success`/`bg-success`
- [x] AddBudget/AddGoal dialog form parity (DialogFooter, Cancel, asterisks, name attrs, missing isSubmitting reset)
- [x] consult page: flex-1 conversation height, real animation-delay on dots, isLoading reset only after stream completes
- [x] transactions edit: button reads "Discard" while editing; drop the `Button asChild` wrapping a button
- [x] `ListItem` rows have hover background, cursor, and focus-visible ring
- [x] middleware allowlists `/manifest.webmanifest`, `/icons/*`, `/favicon.ico` for PWA install previews
